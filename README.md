What To Wear is a basic full stack application that allows users to login, create clothing cards, display cards, delete cards, view other individuals cards, update their profile information, and more!

This project was very developmental for me as it taught me tons of foundational full stack skills. These include things like frontend - backend communication and error handling (API creation), fetch request and proper API communcation methods, REST API's, routing, database model creation in MongoDB, controller creation for backend request handling, middleware applications in backend development (body parsing, centralized error handling, security headers, data validation packages), site security (XXS, DDos, XSRF), and more. I implemented responsive design as well. Particularly with regards to getting images of different sizes to scale correctly at different screen dimensions. Moreover, this project furthered my understanding of the use & creation of modal popups, form validation, user authentication, secure data storage, JSON Web tokens, and much more!
